# Let's Quiz


This is an online quiz organizing website project, developed using Python's web framework Django.<br>
For front-end designing I have used Twitter's front-end library Bootstrap4.

## Current Features

### Site access features:

- User must be logged in to access the Quiz.
- For signup user is required to give _username_, _first name_, _last name_, _e-mail address_ and _password_.
- For login the user will be required to enter _username_ and _password_ only.

### Features of the quiz:

- All questions are multiple choice question.
- Each question is displayed only once per user.
- Questions are displayed randomly for every user.
- If the user by-mistake presses refresh or go back to the previous page, there will be a new question for the user and the
  question he/she was on will be marked as attempted.
- A message will be displayed after every attempted question whether the answer was correct or incorrect.

### Leaderboard features:

- Leaderboard is a shorted list according to the score obtained by the users.
- If two users are having same score, the user who has signed up earlier will have good ranking than the one who joined late.
- Leaderboard is open to all. No login required.

### Administrative features:

- Only admin can add questions.
- Admin can add questions and modify them until they are not marked as _Has been published?_
- Once a question has been published, it can neither be modified nor can be accessed. Admin can only see a list of questions.
- Admin can search questions by question text or choice text.
- Admin can filter questions based on whether the questions have been published or not.
